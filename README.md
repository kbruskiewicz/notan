## Why "Notan"?

In visual art, "Nōtan" (濃淡) [is the practice of composing with light and dark shapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notan) to bring different parts of the composition into relief. Using Notan lays the foundation of compositions – without Notan, their structure becomes muddled. Working with Notan alone produces minimalist compositions.
